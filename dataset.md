# Dataset
## GLOBOSERVE: Global demand and service rates for air transport network
Globoserve is a dataset that contains the global demand and service rates (take-offs and landings) for all major airports derived from [OpenSky's ADS-B data](https://opensky-network.org/). The dataset can be useful to predict delays, congestion, and other metrics; as well as serving as a benchmark for optimization algorithms.

The dataset will be available soon. Stay tuned!
