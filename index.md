## Leisure Project: A Productivity Tool
{: .right-50}
Using React Native, React and Firebase, I designed a small Raspberry Pi-powered smart display that shows me the to-do list with Pomodoro functions. By keeping track of the time until the next calendar event, I am also prevented from forgetting to attend meetings. By doing so, I am able to increase my productivity and stay on top of dozens of hundred tasks throughout the day.
