# Skills

During my research, I have utilized various software and libraries:

- SUMO, ARTERY, INET for wireless network simulations.

- Developed a C++ library for Spherical Codec.

- Use R to analyze the results.

- Use Python to prototype the algorithms. I am familiar with sklearn, skfda and standard machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, numpy, scipy...

I'm also familiar with web and mobile app development using the React framework, Node.JS, MongoDB, and ExpressJS ecosystems.

# Hobbies

I like to read psychological books in my free time, and often find myself conseilling my close friends and family. I also read more about math due to my long-held admiration of the French for their approach to mathematics.

Recently GPT models picked up my interest.
